## Abstract
Traditional underwater propeller fault diagnosis methods have difficulty adapting to domain shift challenges arising from variations in size and rotational speed. To address this challenge, an innovative cross-size fault diagnosis method is proposed, integrating domain adversarial training, spectral attention mechanisms, and a multi-task learning framework...

## Data Availability
The dataset used in this research will be made publicly available after the paper is accepted for publication. **The code will not be shared.**

Please check back later for the data release! The data will include underwater acoustic signals, corresponding health states, and rotational speed variations for both small and large propellers.
